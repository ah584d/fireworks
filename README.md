## Decision justification in code
1. You could find some weird things in my code, I would be glad to explain my decisions, in general I tried to keep the code clean,
   but due to the limited time that I got (working on evening only :-) ) I did some "shortcut" that I would not have done for prod. application.

## Installation

1. make sure you run with node 18 and above
2. git clone git@github.com:ah584d/fireworks.git
3. cd fireworks
4. npm ci -d
5. cd ios
6. pod install
7. run Xcode and open ios folder, then press play button, it will take a few minutes and will launch the application

## Usage

1. Tested on iPhone simulator ** only ** [ I don't have iphone device ]
2. The application usage is self explained, the only "hidden" faeature is that you need to long press on an expense in order to edit/delete it
