8. filtering
9. date picker


## Left over

1. Input field validation with regexp
2. Unit test

## Reasons Behind Technical Choices
1. You might find some unusual elements in my code, and I would be happy to explain my decisions. In general, I aimed to maintain clean code. However, due to the limited time available (I only worked on it during the evenings), I took some shortcuts that I wouldn't have taken in a production application.

## Installation

1. make sure you run with node 18 and above
2. git clone git@github.com:ah584d/fireworks.git
3. cd fireworks
4. npm ci -d
5. cd ios
6. pod install
7. run Xcode and open ios folder, then press play button, it will take a few minutes and will launch the application

## Usage

1. Tested on iPhone simulator ** only ** [ I don't have iphone device ]
2. The application usage is self explained, the only "hidden" feature is that you need to long press on an expense in order to edit/delete it
